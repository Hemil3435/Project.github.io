                <p class="lead mt-5">Artificial intelligence (AI) is truly a revolutionary feat of computer science, set
                    to become a core component of all modern software over the coming years and decades. This presents a
                    threat but also an opportunity. AI will be deployed to augment both defensive and offensive cyber
                    operations. Additionally, new means of cyber attack will be invented to take advantage of the
                    particular weaknesses of AI technology. Finally, the importance of data will be amplified by AI’s
                    appetite for large amounts of training data, redefining how we must think about data protection.
                    Prudent governance at the global level will be essential to ensure that this era-defining technology
                    will bring about broadly shared safety and prosperity.</p>

                <p class="lead">In general terms, AI refers to computational tools that are able to substitute for human
                    intelligence in the performance of certain tasks. This technology is currently advancing at a
                    breakneck pace, much like the exponential growth experienced by database technology in the late
                    twentieth century. Databases have grown to become the core infrastructure that drives
                    enterprise-level software. Similarly, most of the new value added from software over the coming
                    decades is expected to be driven, at least in part, by AI.

                    Within the last decade, databases have evolved significantly in order to handle the new phenomenon
                    dubbed “big data.” This refers to the unprecedented size and global scale of modern data sets,
                    largely gathered from the computer systems that have come to mediate nearly every aspect of daily
                    life. For instance, YouTube receives over 400 hours of video content each minute (Brouwer 2015).</p>

                <p class="lead">Hardly a day passes without a news story about a high-profile data breach or a cyber
                    attack costing millions of dollars in damages. Cyber losses are difficult to estimate, but the
                    International Monetary Fund places them in the range of US$100–$250 billion annually for the global
                    financial sector (Lagarde 2012). Furthermore, with the ever-growing pervasiveness of computers,
                    mobile devices, servers and smart devices, the aggregate threat exposure grows each day. While the
                    business and policy communities are still struggling to wrap their heads around the cyber realm’s
                    newfound importance, the application of AI to cyber security is heralding even greater changes One
                    of the essential purposes of AI is to automate tasks that previously would have required human
                    intelligence. Cutting down on the labour resources an organization must employ to complete a
                    project, or the time an individual must devote to routine tasks, enables tremendous gains in
                    efficiency. For instance, chatbots can be used to field customer service questions, and medical
                    assistant AI can be used to diagnose diseases based on patients’ symptoms.</p>

                </h2>
                <p class="lead">AI technology will alter the cyber security environment in yet another way as its hunger
                    for data changes what kind of information constitutes a useful asset, transforming troves of
                    information that would not previously have been of interest into tempting targets for hostile
                    actors.

                    While some cyber attacks aim solely to disrupt, inflict damage or wreak havoc, many intend to
                    capture strategic assets such as intellectual property. Increasingly, aggressors in cyberspace are
                    playing a long-term game, looking to acquire data for purposes yet unknown. The ability of AI
                    systems to make use of even innocuous data is giving rise to the tactic of “data hoovering” —
                    harvesting whatever information one can and storing it for future strategic use, even if that use is
                    not well defined at present.

                    A recent report from The New York Times illustrates an example of this strategy in action (Sanger et
                    al. 2018). The report notes that the Chinese government has been implicated in the theft of personal
                    data from more than 500 million customers of the Marriott hotel chain. Although commonly the chief
                    concern regarding data breaches is the potential misuse of financial information, in this case the
                    information could be used to track down suspected spies by examining travel habits, or to track and
                    detain individuals to use them as bargaining chips in other matters.</p>

                        class="text-muted"></span></h2>
                <p class="lead">These unfolding developments will force a rethinking of prevailing cyber security
                    strategies. In an increasingly interconnected system, identifying the weakest link becomes more
                    challenging, but also more essential. As sensors, machines and people become interwoven providers of
                    data for valuable AI systems, there will be a proliferation of entry points for cyber attacks. Cyber
                    security requires a comprehensive strategy to minimize weakest links; a piecemeal approach to cyber
                    policy will not work. Since the training data that feeds the most important and revolutionary AI
                    technologies is global in scope, gathered from across many different countries, it is clear that
                    governance at the national level alone will not suffice.

                    Global policy makers have begun turning their attention to the ramifications of widespread AI
                    technology, and its effect on cyber security in particular. The Group of Seven (G7) turned its
                    attention to the governance of AI during the 2018 summit in Charlevoix, Quebec, pledging to “promote
                    human-centric AI” through appropriate investments in cyber security, while paying heed to privacy
                    and personal information protection regarding the data that serves as the raw input for machine
                    learning (G7 2018).</p>
